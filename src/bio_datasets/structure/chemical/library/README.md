The Chemical Component Dictionary is as an external reference file describing all residue and small molecule components found in PDB entries. This dictionary contains detailed chemical descriptions for standard and modified amino acids/nucleotides, small molecule ligands, and solvent molecules. Each chemical definition includes descriptions of chemical properties such as stereochemical assignments, chemical descriptors (SMILES & InChI), systematic chemical names, and idealized coordinates (generated using Molecular Networks' Corina, and if there are issues, OpenEye's OMEGA).
